#Explaination
The Files (Images and Video only) are send to Storage where you can create folders and subfolders to organize your files.
The php engine will read all your architecture and display it in the Index.php! 
The routes are made on the same way than my personal Router, **DO NOT REMOVE** .htaccess file!

#Future Specs
	* An administration to upload / remove / modify the files.
	* A theme section to Customize the Gallery!
